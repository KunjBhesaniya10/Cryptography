# Vigenère Cipher Breaking and Image Encryption

## Overview

This project contains two components:
1. **Breaking the Vigenère Cipher**: A program to decrypt a Vigenère cipher using statistical techniques.
2. **Image Encryption**: Encrypt an image using basic XOR operation with key stream and using AES encryption

## Requirements

To run these programs, you will need the following dependencies:

### Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:
1. **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
2. **Pillow**: For image handling (loading, saving, and processing).
3. **PyCryptodome**: For AES encryption.

### Installation

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pillow pycryptodome
